#Password Hashing

Storing passwords is always a tricky proposition. For a great number of sites they have simply washed their hands of the responsibility by outsourcing to a third party such as Twitter, Google or even Facebook. This is usually done through a system known as OpenID. It exploits the difference between authentication and authorization. Authentication is proving that somebody is who they say they are. This can be done with a password or through a multi-factor system that can include text messages or an app on a cell phone.

Authorization is the act of matching a user with a set of permissions. So I could be authenticated as Simon and authorized to edit bugs.

When storing a password there are a couple of ways to do it - most all of them are wrong. Encryping passwords seems like a good idea at first but if the encrypted passwords are leaked, as seems to happen with alarming regularity, then an attacker could decrypt the passwords. This is a bad situation because many people reuse passwords from site to site. With a password and an e-mail address it is possible the attacker could log inot a banking website. This is the reason that it is recommended that you use distinct passwords for each website.

Hashing passwords is a far better idea. A hash is a one-way function that cannot be reversed to reveal the password. When hashing it is important to hash not just the user's password but to combine it with a nonance. A nonance, sometimes erroniously called a salt, is a string of random characters that is appended to the unhashed password before hashing. This random string acts as protection from an attack using rainbow tables. A rainbow table is a large database that maps passwords with the hashes they generate. Many popular hashing algorithms have rainbow tables which permit near instantanious exploration of a large percentage of the key-space. Nonances invalidate this approach as the key in the rainbow table maps to the password + nonance. Without knowing the nonance an attacker is not able to enter any password that will work. The key in the rainbow table is unlikely to be the actual user password and more likley to be a string that simply hashes to the same value so it will not be obvious what the users's password is.
