BugTracker.NET
==============

Evolving a legacy ASP.NET application to the modern ASP.NET stack. 

Follow us here as we evolve the [original BugTracker.NET](http://ifdefined.com/bugtrackernet.html) to the latest version of ASP.NET. 

Thank you to [Corey Trager](http://ifdefined.com/www/) for his permission to use BugTracker.NET in this project.

NOTE: This project is not intended to replace the original BugTracker.NET. The purpose of this project is to show examples of how you can evolve an older ASP.NET application to make use of newer technology and modern web development practices. The version of [BugTracker.NET on Source Forge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/btnet/) is more fully featured and actively supported. We do not currently recommend that this GitHub version of BugTracker.NET is used in a production environment.
