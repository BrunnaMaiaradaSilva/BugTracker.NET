BugTracker.NET
==============

Evolving a legacy ASP.NET application to the modern ASP.NET stack.

Follow us here as we evolve the [original BugTracker.NET](http://ifdefined.com/bugtrackernet.html) to the latest version of ASP.NET.

Thank you to [Corey Trager](http://ifdefined.com/www/) for his permission to use BugTracker.NET in this project.
